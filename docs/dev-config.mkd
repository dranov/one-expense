The following document assumes a Debian GNU/Linux operating system.


## Prerequisites

Install necessary packages:

    sudo apt-get install python2.7 python2.7-dev python-pip mysql-server mysql-client libmysqlclient-dev mysql-workbench git
    
Unless otherwise specified, all passwords are `redteam` on the development environment.

The git repository currently resides at `https://github.com/dranov/one-expense`

Backend framework:

    sudo pip install flask peewee MYSQL-python faker fake-factory


## Configure MySQL

Edit `/etc/mysql/my.cnf` and set `bind-address = 0.0.0.0` to tell MySQL to listen on all interfaces.

Make it possible to connect to user `root` from `192.168.0.100`. Replace `192.168.0.100` with your IP.

    $ mysql -u root -p
    Enter password:

    mysql> use mysql

    mysql> GRANT ALL ON *.* to root@'192.168.0.100' IDENTIFIED BY 'redteam'; 

    mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    
Pentru a creea baza de date `oxp`:
    
    CREATE DATABASE oxp
      DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8
      DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_general_ci;

## Clone the repo

    git clone git@github.com:dranov/one-expense.git
    
## Point API to MySQL

By default, the API will try to connect to MySQL using the settings in `backend/oxp/settings.py`. If these settings are not OK for your environment, **DO NOT** modify `backend/oxp/settings.py`.

Instead, create the file `backend/oxp/my_settings.py` and overwrite any default configuration options in that file. `my_settings.py` is not tracked in version control. This way, `settings.py` contains sensible defaults and we don't polute the repository with settings for *our* particular environments.


## Create tables filled with random data

    ./backend/init_db.py
